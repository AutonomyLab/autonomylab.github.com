<li> 2013.5.31: <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~jwawerla">Jens Wawerla</a> will be joining us as a University
Research Associate from 1 July 2013. Jens will do basic and applied
research on UAVs and long-term autonomy. Thanks to <a href="http://bgcengineering.com">BGC Engineering</a> and
<a href="http://ncfrn.mcgill.ca">NCFRN</a> for funding to make this possible.

<li> 2013.2.25: We are proud to be part of the <a href="http://ncfrn.mcgill.ca/">NSERC Canadian Field Robotics Network</a>, a partnership between <a href="http://ncfrn.mcgill.ca/people">many excellent researchers and companies</a>, led by <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dudek/">Greg Dudek of McGill</a>. We meet every spring somewhere in Canada for a week-long field trial.<br>

<li> 2011.3.14: MSc student <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/brianmilliganprojects/">Brian Milligan</a> won the prize for Best Video at <a href="http://hri2011.net">HRI'11</a> with his video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2qTlSuGqs">Selecting and Commanding Groups of Robots Using Vision</a>. 

<li>2010.12.17: Congratulations to <a
